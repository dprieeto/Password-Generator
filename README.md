# Password Generator
A simple Password generator application built in java using Swing GUI Forms.

- **Java version:** JDK 22
+ **IDE:** Netbeans 21

> [!Note]
> Passwords are generated using `SecureRandom` from the `java.security` package. The algorithm used is based on the Windows PRNG.

For more details on `SecureRandom`, refer to the [Java SecureRandom Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html).

> [!Tip]
> For stronger passwords, consider using characters like 'ç', 'ñ', 'Ç', and 'Ñ' if supported by the application.
